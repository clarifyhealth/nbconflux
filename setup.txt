The existing code was having trouble finding the template.

Doing this worked - maybe there is another way to let it use the existing directories:

create a directory if it doesn't exist: ~/.local/share/jupyter/nbconvert/templates/confluence/

put the conf.json here into it:

{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "confluence"
  }
}

and then copy the confluence template into it and rename it:

cp nbconflux/confluence.tpl ~/.local/share/jupyter/nbconvert/templates/confluence/index.html.j2
